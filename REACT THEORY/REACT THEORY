  #COMPONENTS
  
  * they are the core building blocks for creating resuable html prompts 
  
  
  #JSX
  
  * it is the react propriteory wrapper of react around javascript
  * helps in building COMPONENTS using the html syntax

  #WHY REACT?

  * react is more speedy than the vanila js because of its virtual DOM feature
  * resuable web COMPONENTS
  
  #functional components:
  
  it is a good convention to keep every functional/class component  in the different files 
  also we will need to import react in that case to make sure that the jsx is working properly
  
  so basically to make a "good" functional component
  
  1. create a separate file with name same as the component name
  
  2. import react 
  
  3. write the function component
  
  4. export it using -> export default {componentName};
  
  5. import the file in the main index.js file
